|**Since Mar 2023<br/><br/>Temporary Assistant Professor in Computer Science**<br/>**(Ricercatore a tempo determinato tipo A in Informatica)**<br/>Department of Mathematics, University of Padova, Italy<br/>|


|**Apr 2022 - Feb 2023<br/><br/>Postdoctoral researcher holding an italian Assegno di Ricerca**<br/>**Sintesi di controllori per systemi ciberfisici (Controller synthesis for cyber-physical systems)**<br/>Department of Mathematics, University of Padova, Italy<br/>Supervisor: Prof. Davide Bresolin<br/><br/>My contribution involved the applycation of supervisory control techniques for the design, validation and synthesis of execution strategies for the enactment of business processes under uncertainty, in a maximally-permissive fashion. Particular attention was devoted to concurrency, to the modularity of the approach, and to new kinds of constraints in process instances that specify subsets of activies that can, must, or might repeat an arbitrary number of times. A further research line involved problem of optimal repair of Data Petri Nets, a state-of-the-art formalism to model data-aware business processes, where the executions of the processes are influenced by the current values valori of read and written data.|

|**Apr 2019 - Mar 2021<br/><br/>Postdoctoral researcher holding an italian Assegno di Ricerca**<br/>**Definizione e sviluppo di algoritmi e modelli per la progettazione industriale (Definition and development of algorithms and methods for industrial design)**<br/>Department of Computer Science, University of Verona, Italy<br/>Supervisor: Prof. Tiziano Villa<br/><br/>My contribution involved planning problems under uncertainty by means of temporal network frameworks. Such networks allow to model a set of activities in a plan that must be executed by satisfying all delay and/or deadline constraints in a way that depends on the uncontrollable events that are being observed during execution. Some uncontrollable events are, for example, uncontrollable durations, uncontrollable conditions (e.g., emergency/not emergency), the avaliability of resources (e.g., absense of users), or uncontrollable resource committments for task executions. I faced computational complexity analyses and developed algorithms for the synthesis of execution strategies. I also worked on problems regarding the mining of temporal networks from execution traces.|

|**Jan 2014 - May 2018<br/><br/>Ph.D. student holding full italian scholarship**<br/>**Thesis: Temporal and Resource Controllability of Workflows Under Uncertainty**<br/>Department of Computer Science, University of Verona, Italy<br/>Supervisor: Prof. Luca Viganò<br/><br/>Workflow technology has long been employed for the modeling, validation and execution of business processes. A workflow is a formal description of a business process in which single atomic work units (tasks), organized in a partial order, are assigned to processing entities (agents) in order to achieve some business goal(s). Workflows can also employ workflow paths (projections with respect to a total truth value assignment to the Boolean variables associated to the conditional split connectors) in order (not) to execute a subset of tasks. A workflow management system coordinates the execution of tasks that are part of workflow instances such that all relevant constraints are eventually satisfied. Temporal workflows specify business processes subject to temporal constraints such as controllable or uncontrollable durations, delays and deadlines. The choice of a workflow path may be controllable or not, considered either in isolation or in combination with uncontrollable durations. Access controlled workflows specify workflows in which users are authorized for task executions and authorization constraints say which users remain authorized to execute which tasks depending on who did what. Access controlled workflows may consider workflow paths too other than the uncertain availability of resources (users, throughout this thesis). When either a task duration or the choice of the workflow path to take or the availability of a user is out of control, we need to verify that the workflow can be executed by verifying all constraints for any possible combination of behaviors arising from the uncontrollable parts. Indeed, users might be absent before starting the execution (static resiliency), they can also become so during execution (decremental resiliency) or they can come and go throughout the execution (dynamic resiliency). Temporal access controlled workflows merge the two previous formalisms by considering several kinds of uncontrollable parts simultaneously. Authorization constraints may be extended to support conditional and temporal features. A few years ago some proposals addressed the temporal controllability of workflows by encoding them into temporal networks to exploit "off-the-shelf" controllability checking algorithms available for them. However, those proposals fail to address temporal controllability where the controllable and uncontrollable choices of workflow paths may mutually influence one another. Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge, controllability of access controlled workflows subject to uncontrollable workflow paths and algorithms to validate and execute dynamically resilient workflows remain unexplored. To overcome these limitations, this thesis goes for exact algorithms by addressing temporal and resource controllability of workflows under uncertainty. I provide several new classes of (temporal) constraint networks and corresponding algorithms to check their controllability. After that, I encode workflows into these new formalisms. I also provide an encoding into instantaneous timed games to model static, decremental and dynamic resiliency and synthesize memoryless execution strategies. I developed a few tools with which I carried out some initial experimental evaluations.<br/>[Link to thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/11562/979769)|
