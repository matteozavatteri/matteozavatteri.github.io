|**Since 2023**<br/><center><a href="https://www.consorzioinest.it/en/"><img src="/images/Icone_spokes_300x300_Spoke_9.svg" width="50%" height="50%"/></a></center><br/>**Researcher** of the project **iNEST: INTERCONNECTED NORD-EST INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM**<br/>**Member of Spoke 9** - Models, methods, computing technologies for digital twin<br/><br/>Supported with 100M€ by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza, [PNRR](https://www.mef.gov.it/en/focus/The-National-Recovery-and-Resilience-Plan-NRRP/)), iNEST is a project funded by the European Union in the [**NextGenerationEU**](https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/index_en) program. The iNEST ecosystem, where the role of University of Padova is that of proposer, was put together to rapidly enhance and extend the benefits of digital technologies of the key areas of north east Italy: industry and manufacturing, agriculture, sea, mountain, construction building, tourism, culture, health and food. The iNEST ecosystem consists of 24 partners among which all Universities of north east Italy, public national research centers, public and private highly qualified industrial realities. Its structure has a central operative hub located in Padova, managing and coordinating the project, and nine Spoke nodes spread in the north east Italy territory, where the research activities are located and other affiliates are involved by means of specific agreements. The research topic of [spoke 9](https://www.consorzioinest.it/en/model-methods-computing-technologies-for-digital-twin-2/) (Model, Methods, Computing Technologies for Digital Twin), that funds my temporary assistant professor in Padova, concerns research and technological transfer in the areas of mathematical and numeric models, scientific computation, and digital twins.<br/><br/>My contribution is to apply formal methods and artificial intelligence techniques to model, validate, and control complex data-driven systems.|

|**2020**<br/><br/>**Member** of the project **Ragionamento Strategico e Sintesi Automatica di Sistemi Multi-Agente**<br/>**(Strategic reasoning and automated synthesis of multiagent systems)**<br/>P.I. Fabio Mogavero, University of Naples Federico II, Italy<br/>Funded by [INdAM-GNCS](https://www.altamatematica.it/gncs/) with 3000€  this project put together members from the CNR — Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione, University of Ferrara, University of Genova, Università degli Studi del Molise, University of Napoli Federico II, University of Padova, University of Roma La Sapienza, University of Roma Foro Italico, University of Salerno, University of Udine, University of Verona.<br/><br/>My contribution to the project concerned the development of formalisms and algorithms for weak, strong, and dynamic controllability of temporal networks where time is considered both qualitative and quantitative with particular attention to mining algorithms.|

|**2019**<br/><br/>**Member** of the project **Metodi Formali per tecniche di verifica combinata**<br/>**(Formal methods for combined verification techniques)**<br/>P.I. Dario Della Monica, University of Udine, Italy<br/>Funded by [INdAM-GNCS](https://www.altamatematica.it/gncs/) with 7000€ this project put together members from University of Udine, University of Verona, University of Ferrara, University of Padova, University of Bologna, University of Roma "La Sapienza", University of Salerno, Università Roma 3, CNR-Istituro di Scienze e Tecnlogie della Cognizione, University of Napoli "Federico II", University of Genova, University of Modena Reggio Emilia.<br/><br/>My contribution to the project concerned the development of formalisms and algorithms for weak, strong, and dynamica controllolability of temporal networks where time is considered both qualitative and quantitative with particular attention to the resources that a process instance must commit for the execution of its tasks.|


|**From 2019 to 2022**<br/><br/><center><a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=progetto&id=4935&lang=en"><img src="/images/dipartimento-di-eccellenza.png" width="50%" height="50%"/></a></center><br/>**Participant** of the project **Dipartimenti di eccellenza 2018 - 2022 - Informatica per l'industria 4.0**<br/>**(Departments of Excellence, Computer Engineering for Industry 4.0)**<br/>P.I. Franco Fummi, University of Verona, Italy<br/>Funded by [MIUR](https://www.mur.gov.it/it/aree-tematiche/universita/programmazione-e-finanziamenti/dipartimenti-di-eccellenza/DdE2018-2022) with 8M€ the project Computer Engineering for Industry 4.0 spanned from 2018 to 2022 to extend the Department research areas with the development of a new research action in computer science for Industry 4.0, making the computer science technologies usable and accessible for companies in this new industrial reality.<br/><br>My contribution to the project concerned the renewal of master's degree courses, where toward advanced teaching, I created the module of supervisory control for the course of System Design Laboratory (SDL) as part of the master's degree in Computer Engineering for Robotics and Smart Industry. At the beginning of this project, the course of Discrete Event Systems held by Prof. Tiziano Villa discussed in one part the topic of supervisory control from a theoretical point of view only. At that time a laboratory part on that topic was missing. Such a new course bridged the gap to offer students the chance to practice with mature software tools for the development of supervisory controllers. The chosen software for this purpose was Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit ([ESCET](https://www.eclipse.org/escet/)) originally developed by TU/Eindhoven as a result of a few past european projects.|
