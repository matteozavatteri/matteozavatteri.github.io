## Formal Methods for AI - in collaboration with Collins Aerospace

**Focus Area:** *AI Trustworthiness and Certification in Aviation Applications*

**Description:** The use of AI components in safety-critical aviation systems (e.g., avionics) brings various
benefits in terms of performance and enables new functionalities that are not possible to implement in
traditional software. Such systems often require certification from global aviation authorities and,
therefore, must exhibit high level of trust and guarantees on the absence of unintended behavior. This
is specifically challenging for Machine Learning (ML) based systems (including Deep Learning and
Reinforcement Learning), since ML models, such as neural networks, are complex and black box.
Trustworthiness of AI/ML is achieved by providing design assurance, i.e., evidence that certain
guidelines and verification processes have been followed during design and deployment. R&D activities
in this area shall focus on the exploration of novel methods for development and verification of AI/ML
models in aviation applications. This includes data collection and data assurance techniques (e.g.,
completeness analysis), optimization techniques for ML models (e.g., simplification, distillation) to
improve their performance, explainability and verifiability, formal and statistical analysis approaches for
neural networks, and new processes for providing guarantees and guardrails during deployment and
updating the AI/ML systems [EASA24, FAA24]. The obtained outcomes shall contribute to existing
guidelines for AI/ML development in aviation by offering new means of compliance with certification
objectives.
The following thesis proposals provide a (not exhaustive) list of subjects that are of relevance for Master
theses and internship in this context.
